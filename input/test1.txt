Write a program that reads a plain text file (regardless of its actual format—for example a markup
language format, such as HTML or XML, or a spreadsheet format such as CSV) and counts the
number of lines, words, and characters in the file. Write both a recursive version and a version
based on map/filter/reduce array methods (use any or all of the array methods—as you believe is
needed to solve the problem). State explicitly whether you counted the whitespaces and empty
lines. Write the unit tests for your programs using either a testing framework such as Jasmine
(mentioned on page Error! Bookmark not defined.), or write test classes/functions without
frameworks, as illustrated in Section 1.1.3 (page 10). If using a framework, specify the source and the version needed to run your tests. Include sample test inputs and expected outputs.
